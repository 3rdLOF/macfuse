1. Download and install the MacFUSE Core package available under the "Downloads" tab of this project. You should restart after installing.

2. Download and try MacFUSE file systems such as SSHFS ([MACFUSE_FS_SSHFS]) and SpotlightFS ([MACFUSE_FS_SPOTLIGHTFS]).

3. Write your own MacFUSE file systems, or try numerous existing ones that were written for Linux FUSE. To compile existing file systems, you may need additional software (such as `glib` and `libintl`). To learn more about the details of MacFUSE development and advanced usage, please read the [HOWTO].
