1. Download and install the MacFUSE Core package available under the "Downloads" tab of this project. You should restart after installing. To make sure you are aware of late breaking caveats (if any) with the MacFUSE release you're using, check the [0_READ_THIS_FIRST] page before proceeding.

2. Download and try MacFUSE file systems such as SSHFS ([MACFUSE_FS_SSHFS]) and SpotlightFS ([MACFUSE_FS_SPOTLIGHTFS]).

3. Write your own MacFUSE file systems, or try numerous existing ones that were written for Linux FUSE. To compile existing file systems, you may need additional software (such as `glib` and `libintl`). To learn more about the details of MacFUSE development and advanced usage, please read the [HOWTO].
