= failed to exec mount program =

Q: When trying to use a fuse-based filesystem, I get:

{{{
fuse: failed to exec mount program: No such file or directory
}}}

A: The fuse library calls out to `mount_fusefs` to do the mount. By default, it's located in `/usr/local/bin`. So check:

  # Is `/usr/local/bin` in your `PATH`?
  # Is `mount_fusefs` there? It should be a symlink to `/System/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/mount_fusefs`.
  # The target of the symlink should exist.
