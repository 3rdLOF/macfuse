= Compiling a FUSE File System =

Q: I'm having problem XYZ compiling a FUSE file system in the MacFUSE environment. What to do?

A: Besides any other file-system-specific compile- or configure-time options, you need to have `-D__FreeBSD__=10` in your `CFLAGS`. Try something like:

{{{
$ CFLAGS="-D__FreeBSD__=10" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
}}}

You may also need `-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64` in `CFLAGS` unless it's already there.

= Ejecting in the Finder =

Q: I can't eject a MacFUSE volume using the eject icon in the Finder.

A: Are you using an older release of MacFUSE? If so, please upgrade to the latest. To learn more about Finder-related woes, please read http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/MACFUSE_AND_THE_FINDER

= fusermount =

Q: How should I unmount my fuse-based filesystem? I can't find `fusermount` anywhere.

A: Just use the standard `umount` command in Mac OS X. You don't need `fusermount`.

= failed to exec mount program =

Q: When trying to use a fuse-based filesystem, I get:

{{{
fuse: failed to exec mount program: No such file or directory
}}}

A: Are you using an older release of MacFUSE? If so, please upgrade to the latest. You shouldn't see this error in newer releases (beginning with MacFUSE 0.1.7).

= FUSE Volume 0 =

Q: All my filesystems are showing up in the Finder as "FUSE Volume n" for some number n. What should I do?

A: Use the command-line option `-ovolname=<<some name>>` as well as `-oping_diskarb`.

= Finder "Beachballing" When SSH Connection Drops/Resets/Changes =

Q: When I have an SSHFS volume mounted and something happens to the connection (or my computer wakes up from sleep), the Finder beachballs.

A: Try using the `-o reconnect` option to `sshfs`.
