#summary Frequently asked questions (and answers)

= Install/Uninstall =

Q: What is the preferred way to install MacFUSE?

A: Most users and developers of FUSE file systems should install the "MacFUSE Core.pkg" from the latest MacFUSE Core dmg available from the Downloads tab of:

http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/

Q: How can I uninstall MacFUSE Core?

A: If you installed "MacFUSE Core.pkg" version 0.1.9 or greater then you can use the uninstall script. From a terminal window run the following command:

{{{
sudo /System/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/uninstall-macfuse-core.sh
}}}

If you have the 0.1.0b006 or 0.1.7 release installed then it might be easiest to upgrade to the newest release and then run the uninstall script.

= NTFS Volume Stops Showing Up in Startup Disk Preference Pane =

Q: After installing MacFUSE, my NTFS volume doesn't show up in the Startup Disk preference pane.

A: This issue is fixed beginning with MacFUSE Core 0.1.9. If you want to fix an older release for some reason, find the following line in `/System/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Contents/Info.plist`:

{{{
    ...
    <key>NTFS</key>
    ...
}}}

Change the "NTFS" to "NTFS-3g", so that it reads:

{{{
    ...
    <key>NTFS-3g</key>
    ...
}}}

You'll need administrator privileges to edit this file. Quit and relaunch System Preferences.

A related question could be that the volume shows up in Disk Utility as of type "NTFS 3g" or similar. It's the same issue, and can be remedied by the abovementioned change.

Note that besides MacFUSE's fusefs.fs bundle, another non-Apple .fs bundle could be "taking over" the NTFS personality too -- so make sure.

= Compiling a FUSE File System =

Q: I'm having problem XYZ compiling a FUSE file system in the MacFUSE environment. What to do?

A: Besides any other file-system-specific compile- or configure-time options, you need to have `-D__FreeBSD__=10` in your `CFLAGS`. Try something like:

{{{
$ CFLAGS="-D__FreeBSD__=10" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
}}}

You may also need `-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64` in `CFLAGS` unless it's already there.

= Ejecting in the Finder =

Q: I can't eject a MacFUSE volume using the eject icon in the Finder.

A: Are you using an older release of MacFUSE? If so, please upgrade to the latest. MacFUSE's interaction with the Finder improved greatly in MacFUSE Core 0.1.9. To learn more about the background of Finder-related woes, please read http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/MACFUSE_AND_THE_FINDER

= fusermount =

Q: How should I unmount my fuse-based filesystem? I can't find `fusermount` anywhere.

A: Just use the standard `umount` command in Mac OS X. You don't need `fusermount`.

= failed to exec mount program =

Q: When trying to use a fuse-based filesystem, I get:

{{{
fuse: failed to exec mount program: No such file or directory
}}}

A: Are you using an older release of MacFUSE? If so, please upgrade to the latest. You shouldn't see this error in newer releases (beginning with MacFUSE 0.1.7). If you *do* see this error with a newer release, that means the program you are trying to run is "picking up" an older user library that still wants `mount_fusefs` to be in your `PATH`.

= FUSE Volume 0 =

Q: All my filesystems are showing up in the Finder as "FUSE Volume n" for some number n. What should I do?

A: Use the command-line option `-ovolname=<<some name>>` as well as `-oping_diskarb`.

= Finder "Beachballing" When SSH Connection Drops/Resets/Changes =

Q: When I have an SSHFS volume mounted and something happens to the connection (or my computer wakes up from sleep), the Finder beachballs.

A: Try using the `-o reconnect` option to `sshfs`. MacFUSE Core 0.1.9 introduced better Finder interaction, along with the `-o daemon_timeout` option that lets you specify a hard upper limit after which a "hung" volume will be automatically ejected.
