= Compiling a FUSE File System =

Q: I'm having problem XYZ compiling a FUSE file system in the MacFUSE environment. What to do?

A: Besides any other file-system-specific compile- or configure-time options, you need to have `-D__FreeBSD__=10` in your `CFLAGS`. Try something like:

{{{
$ CFLAGS="-D__FreeBSD__=10" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
}}}

You may also need `-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64` in `CFLAGS` unless it's already there.

= Ejecting in the Finder =

Q: I can't eject a MacFUSE volume using the eject icon in the Finder.

A: Please read http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/MACFUSE_AND_THE_FINDER

= fusermount =

Q: How should I unmount my fuse-based filesystem? I can't find `fusermount` anywhere.

A: `umount`.

= failed to exec mount program =

Q: When trying to use a fuse-based filesystem, I get:

{{{
fuse: failed to exec mount program: No such file or directory
}}}

A: The fuse library calls out to `mount_fusefs` to do the mount. By default, it's located in `/usr/local/bin`. So check:

  # Is `/usr/local/bin` in your `PATH`?
  # Is `mount_fusefs` there? It should be a symlink to `/System/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/mount_fusefs`.
  # The target of the symlink should exist.

= FUSE Volume 0 =

Q: All my filesystems are showing up in the Finder as "FUSE Volume n" for some number n. What should I do?

A: Use the command-line option `-ovolname=<<some name>>` as well as `-oping_diskarb`.

= Problems with an Updated Kernel Extension =

Q: I upgraded to a newer version of the binary tarball and now I am having issues with loading fusefs.kext (I keep getting errors about fusefs being not available).

A: Try doing the following:

{{{
$ sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions
/* Now reboot. */
}}}
