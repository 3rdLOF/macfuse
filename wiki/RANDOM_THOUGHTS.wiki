#summary Random Thoughts on MacFUSE from the Developers

= Introduction =

This page contains random anecdotes, musings, tidbits, tips, tricks, trivia, and other miscellaneous information about MacFUSE. If we think of something that might be useful or interesting to MacFUSE users, and we are too lazy to find an appropriate document or wiki article to house that information, we'll just put it here.

== Asynchronous Writes ==
Although there are numerous optimization opportunities in MacFUSE right now, here's one flag that you can experiment with to see if it makes writing data any faster for you. The flag is `-onosyncwrites`. By default, MacFUSE always writes synchronously, which is rather expensive, but safer for many scenarios in which MacFUSE is meant to operate. Think "faster, but dangerous". Of course, it's dangerous only if things go wrong (network connection went down or device unplugged or you ran out of space), but you have been warned.
