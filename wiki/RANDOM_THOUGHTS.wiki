#summary Random Thoughts on MacFUSE from the Developers

= Introduction =

This page contains random anecdotes, musings, tidbits, tips, tricks, trivia, and other miscellaneous information about MacFUSE. If we think of something that might be useful or interesting to MacFUSE users, and we are too lazy to find an appropriate document or wiki article to house that information, we'll just put it here.

== Integration with "Connect to Server..." ==
The Finder's `Go -> Connect to Server...` menu item lets you mount "remote" resources specified through URI schemes such as afp, ftp, http, nfs, and smb. Given the availability of sshfs, people seem to be looking for a way to "add" ssh/sftp to the list. Well, it's sort of not possible because these URI schemes are handled by plugins that are handled by an Apple-private framework (URLMount.framework). The plugins, which are written using a private interface, reside in `/System/Library/Filesystems/URLMount`.

That said, it 's sort of possible too.

Theoretically speaking, one could reverse engineer the plugin interface. Too much work.

Even simpler, one could just copy, say, `nfs.URLMounter`, to `ssh.URLMounter`. Edit whatever needs to be edited in the plist and the binary. Reboot/relogin etc. The code will call out to `mount_ssh`, and one could take it from there. Of course, there are things like UUIDs that you need to take care of. Hardly pretty (you wouldn't want to ship a product this way), but works for a demo. That's how sshfs was working in "Connect to Server..." during Amit Singh's Macworld 2007 talk.
